# 📌 Overview

UPI Sentinel is a sequence-based fraud detection system designed to analyze contextual transaction behavior instead of evaluating transactions independently.

Traditional fraud systems often rely on isolated transaction analysis, making them less effective against contextual financial fraud patterns.

This project combines:

* CNN for local transaction pattern extraction
* BiLSTM for temporal behavioral understanding
* Attention mechanism for identifying important transaction steps
* FastAPI deployment for real-time inference
* Streamlit dashboard for live fraud monitoring

The system was trained and evaluated using multiple experimentation strategies on highly imbalanced financial transaction data.

# 🎥 Dashboard Demonstration

## Live Fraud Monitoring Dashboard

The dashboard demonstrates:

* Real-time transaction scoring
* Sliding-window sequence inference
* Fraud probability estimation
* Contextual risk analysis
* Live transaction history tracking

# 🧠 Problem Statement

Most fraud detection systems evaluate transactions independently.

However, real-world fraud often emerges through:

* Rapid account draining
* Sequential suspicious transfers
* Behavioral anomalies over time
* Abnormal spending progression

UPI Sentinel addresses this by analyzing transaction sequences using deep learning.

Instead of asking:

> “Is this transaction fraudulent?”

The system asks:

> “Does the recent behavioral sequence appear suspicious?”

# 🔍 Contextual Fraud Detection Example

## Sequence-Based Risk Escalation

![Contextual Fraud Flow](assets/contextual_fraud_story.png)

### Example Scenario

A victim account starts with ₹5000 balance.

The following rapid transactions occur:

| Step | Transaction    | Balance Remaining |
| ---- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1    | ₹2000 TRANSFER | ₹3000             |
| 2    | ₹1500 TRANSFER | ₹1500             |
| 3    | ₹1200 TRANSFER | ₹300              |
| 4    | ₹250 TRANSFER  | ₹50               |
| 5    | ₹10 PAYMENT    | ₹40               |

Although the final ₹10 payment appears normal individually, the system flags it because the previous transaction sequence indicates suspicious account-draining behavior.

This demonstrates contextual sequence-based fraud detection.

### Why this architecture?

### 🔹 CNN Layer

Extracts local transaction patterns such as:

* Sudden spending spikes
* Rapid repetitive transfers
* Abrupt balance changes

### 🔹 BiLSTM Layer

Learns temporal behavioral relationships across transaction history.

### 🔹 Attention Layer

Focuses on the most important transaction steps contributing to fraud probability.

## Experiment Comparison

| Experiment                 | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| CNN + Random Undersampling | 0.13      | 0.94   | 0.23     |
| CNN + Class Weights        | 0.42      | 0.90   | 0.57     |
| CNN + BiLSTM + Attention   | 0.91      | 0.77   | 0.83     |

# ⚙️ Sequence Modeling Strategy

The system uses a sliding-window transaction sequence approach.

### Example

With sequence length = 5:

```text
[T1, T2, T3, T4, T5] → Prediction
[T2, T3, T4, T5, T6] → Prediction
[T3, T4, T5, T6, T7] → Prediction
```

This enables contextual behavioral analysis over time.
